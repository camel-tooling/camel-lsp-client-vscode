For detailed information about Apache Camel supported features, see the [Apache Camel Language Server](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-language-server#features).

### Requirements

**Java 11** is currently required to launch the [Apache Camel Language Server](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-language-server). The `java.home` VS Code preferences can be used to use a different version of JDK than the default one installed on the machine.

⚠️ For some features, [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/index.html) must be available on a system command-line.

For an **XML DSL** files:

- Use an `.xml` file extension.
- Specify the Camel namespace `http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint` or `http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring`

For a **Java DSL** files:

- Use a `.java` file extension.
- Specify Camel (usually from an imported package).
  For example: `import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder`.
- To reference the Camel component, use `from` or `to` and a string without a space. The string cannot be a variable. For example, `from("timer:timerName")` works, but `from( "timer:timerName")` and `from(aVariable)` do not work.
