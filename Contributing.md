# How to provide a new version on VS Code Marketplace

* Check that the version in package.json has not been published yet
** If already published:
*** Upgrade the version in package.json
*** Run 'npm install' so that the package-lock.json is updated
*** Push changes in a PR
*** Wait for PR to be merged
* Point to a release version of Camel Language Server. During development it can point to snapshots but for release it must be a released version.
* Check that someone listed as _submitter_ in Jenkinsfile is available
* Create a tag
* Push the tag to camel-tooling repository, it will trigger a build after few minutes
* Check build is working fine on [Circle CI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/camel-tooling/camel-lsp-client-vscode)
* Start build on [Jenkins CI](https://dev-platform-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/VS%20Code/job/vscode-atlasmap-release) with _publishToMarketPlace_ parameter checked
* Wait the build is waiting on step _Publish to Marketplace_
* Ensure you are logged in
* Go to the console log of the build and click "Proceed"
* Wait few minutes and check that it has been published on VS Code Marketplace
* Keep build forever for later reference and edit build information to indicate the version
* Prepare next iteration:
** Upgrade the version in package.json
** Run 'npm install' so that the package-lock.json is updated
** Push changes in a PR
** Follow PR until it is approved/merged
